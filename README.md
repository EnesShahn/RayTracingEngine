# RayTracingEngine
A project I made for my Applications Of Computer Graphics course.

Since I've been using Unity 3D for a long time, I've decided to try and replicate its Component-Based Architecture while making this Software Ray-Tracing Engine.

Special thanks to Dr. Abdullah Bulbul for giving me this oppurtunity.
I'm proud to say I was the only student to get A+ in this course in my class.
