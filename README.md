# RayTracingEngine
A project I made for my Applications Of Computer Graphics course.

Since I've been using Unity 3D for a long time, I've decided to try and replicate its Component-Based Architecture while making this Software Ray-Tracing Engine.

Special thanks to Dr. Abdullah Bulbul for giving me this oppurtunity.
I'm proud to say with this project I got the first position in my class with A+ grade.

## How To Run
...

## What's Next
- [ ] GPU accelerated rendering
- [ ] Make an example game
